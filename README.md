# ESP32-Internet-Clock

Hello,

in this project, I wanted to build a small clock for my bed table.
As I didn't want to buy one, here is a DIY version based on an ESP32 with a seven segment display. It just connects to a time server over wifi, gatheres the time and displays it. 

To make the code also working for your wlan, adjust wlan name (ssid) and password in the code.
